1. Dataset in the folder

     (a) RowleyShoals.topo.3d:
	 A binary file of the bathymetry around the Rowley Shoals on the Australian NorthWest Shelf in the model domain.
	 			
     (b) Xgrid_meters.txt and Ygrid_meters.txt:
	 Model grid setup in x and y directions.
	   
     (c) Corr_ellipse_params.mat:
   An example of internal wave correlation ellipse from the MITgcm model. It includes semimajor, semiminor axes and the ellipse orientations.

2. Scripts and functions

     (a) get1_Var_correlation: (Mazloff et al. 2018)
         Based on the the 3D matrix of a variable from the model, we can find the correlation of wave properties between neighboring cells.
         This script is to calculateparameters of the correlation ellipse for internal waves, including crest widths, crest lengths and propagation directions.
	   
     (b) plot1_Var_correlation:
         Take the Rowley Shoals MITgcm model as an example, plot the internal wave properties via the correlation ellipse calculation. 
         (Gong et al. 2021).

3. Images in the folder
		 
     (a) Corr_ellipse_IWs.png:
         Correlation ellipses of internal waves around the Rowley Shoals within the entire model domain.
		 
     (b) Corr_lengthscale_IWs.png:
         A four-panel plot, characterizing internal waves properties (i.e. crest lengths, crest widths, and propagation directions) in a small domain.
